# Backend - Running the application:

To run the application simply run docker compose in the terminal of your choice:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This should start the database on port 5432 and the backend server on port 8080. To verify that the database has started correctly read the logs in your terminal (and try to connect with any database tool of your choice). To verify the server go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser and make sure you see the "Server running OK" message.
